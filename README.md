# Lazarus robot project

## Introduction

This robotic project was a university project at UPSSITECH in 2021.
We worked in team of 7 on a robot which is able to map a room.
The team was composed of five french student an two german student who worked from home.

That was a very challenging project by th organization. It was a real pleasure to work on this project.

The team : Andreas Müller, Mathias Bossaerts, Davy Duvivier, Lennart Petsch, Baptiste Pomarelle, Martial Bailly and Théo Trafny.

## Description
This robot allow you to map a room with manual control or with an automatic mode.
We use 4 motors wich are connected to 2 outputs motor controller.
One output for each side of the robot.

We use also a Bluetooth controller for the communication.
 
3 ultrasonic sensors, one front and two on the right side.

2 encoders, one on the right back motor and another on the left back motor


We decided to split the work in three module :

- robot
- decision
- HMI

**The HMI needs to be built with Java 14**

You can found each program in the associated folder.
The main code of the robot is in the `main` folder of arduino folder.
